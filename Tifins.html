<p>
    ingredients:-
    ½ cup idli rice or parboiled rice or regular rice – 100 grams,
½ cup regular rice – 100 grams,
¼ cup urad dal – 50 grams (husked whole or split black gram),
⅛ teaspoon fenugreek seeds or 2 pinches (methi seeds or methi dana),
2 tablespoons thick poha (flattened rice),
1.5 cups water – for soaking both rice and lentils,
¾ cup water – for grinding, do add water as required,
½ teaspoon rock salt edible and food grade or non-iodized salt or sea salt crystals or Himalayan pink salt
</p><br><br>
<p></p>


   <p> preparation:-</p>
    <p>1. In a bowl take ½ cup idli rice or parboiled rice along with ½ cup regular rice. Instead of adding regular rice, you can also make the dosa with a total of 1 cup idli rice as I have shown in the video. Kindly note that the video has the recipe ingredients doubled in proportion.
    
    </p><br>   
    <p> 2.To the same bowl, add ¼ cup urad dal and ⅛ teaspoon fenugreek seeds (methi).</p><br>
    <p>3. Rinse the rice, lentils and methi seeds together a couple of times and keep them aside.</p><br>
    <p>4. In a separate bowl, take 2 tablespoons of thick poha (flattened rice or parched rice).</p><br>
    <p>5. Rinse poha once or twice in water and then add to the bowl containing the rinsed rice+lentils+methi seeds.</p><br>
    <p>6. Add 1.5 cups of water and mix. Cover with a lid and soak everything for 4 to 5 hours.</p><br>
    <p>7. Drain all the water and add the soaked ingredients to a mixer grinder or a blender.and wait for next day</p><br>
   <p> 8.Heat a cast iron pan. When the pan becomes hot, spread ¼ to ½ teaspoon oil all over the pan with a spoon or with a thick paper towel dipped in oil. For a richer taste, you can cook the dosa with ghee or butter.
   </p><br> <p>9.Note that the oil should be spread evenly or else it becomes difficult to spread the batter. If the pan is well seasoned you don’t need to spread oil. I suggest keeping a separate skillet or tawa to make only dosa.

    Do keep the heat on low to low-medium flame, so that you are easily able to spread the batter. If the pan base is very thick, then keep the flame to medium.
    
    For a low-fat option, just make the dosa without any oil. But make sure that your pan is well seasoned. Otherwise the dosa will stick to the pan.
    </p><br><p>10. Now take a ladle full of the dosa batter or about ¼ cup of the batter. Pour the batter and gently spread the batter starting from the center and moving outwards. In the below photo you will see a well-spread dosa batter.
    </p><br><p>11.Cook the dosa on low to medium heat. Do regulate the heat as per the pan size and thickness. You can even cover the dosa with a lid and let it get cooked from the bottom as I do.
